Porter gave us the Five Forces framework to analyse competition and aid strategy development…


Today i give you my ‘Five Farces’ of strategy. My in-exhaustive list of causes of strategy fuck-ups:

## 1) The Ostrich
Whether it be sand or its butt, the head is somewhere it shouldn’t be and its not scanning its environment and understanding its context. Think Kodak.

## 2) Meme Copying
‘Company X had success doing Y and Z, lets do Y and Z too!’ with no assessment of context. Leads to ‘Lets Uberise elderly care’, ‘lets move fast and break stuff like Facebook in our A&E’.

## 3) CxO ego trip
Lack of challenge of ridiculous executive ideas (probably based on 1 and 2) due to Culture of personality/hero worship/psychopathic behaviour/short term self-preservation.

## 4) Tactic as strategy
Can be evidenced by what an old colleague of mine termed the ‘random priority indicator’, a sickening meandering from one priority to the next with no clearly defined end-game or communicable reason why.

## 5) Imaginary Customers
You could call this lack of product/market fit. I’d call it actually having no fucking clue what your customers needs are and instead of doing the hard work to find out creating a meta-narrative that supports your pre-conceptions about what they are, often seen in combinations with 1), 2) and 3).
