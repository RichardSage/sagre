In our previous post in this series on Digital Maturity we talked about Governance & Delivery in the context of Digital Maturity and as one of 6 key parameters of the Mosaic Island digital maturity model and assessment.

In this, the 5th post in the series we will discuss another One of the Six key parameters of Digital maturity, Information Governance.

## Information Governance
A mature Digital organisation is one that has recognized that the capabilities required to manage, analyze and interpret the organisation’s data are capabilities of strategic importance. Data is valued as a key asset as the organisation understands that secure, accurate and accessible data is a key enabler of delivering digital services. We have found a mature approach to information governance and delivery often has the following attributes:

## Security of Organisation and Supply Chain
![Security Cameras](/assets/images/securitycameras.jpg)
The mature Digital organisation has specific roles that are accountable and responsible for information security across the organisation and its supply chain. The organisation has clearly defined and communicated policies and procedures.

## Assurance
The organisation receives regular independent assurance, including testing and audits on the information security of its organisation and of the information security compliance of its partners. The organisation and its suppliers and partners are compliant with the appropriate security standards (e.g. ISO 27001).

## Pervasive Information Security Risk Management

Information security risks are identified, mitigated and managed at all levels within the organisations across BAU and change activities. Key Information Security risks are discussed and managed alongside corporate and strategic risks and owned by senior management.

## Data Awareness

The organisation’s colleagues are aware of the relevant policies, processes and procedures around information management and information security, this is regularly re-enforced through regular learning, training and testing.

## Data Quality and Governance
The organisation has clearly defined data governance processes policies and roles in place. There is clear ownership and stewardship of your key data entities. It has defined KPIS around data quality. It possesses a clear map of where data is located in the organisation and how it is stored, managed and operated upon throughout its lifecycle. The organisation has appropriate tooling in place to automate the management of its data and make it accessible where it is needed.

## Beyond Information Governance
In the next post in this series we will talk about another of the Six key parameter of Digital maturity, Digital Capabilities, what that means, and what good looks like in terms of Digital maturity.
