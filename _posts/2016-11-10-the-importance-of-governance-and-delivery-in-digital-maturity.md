In the previous post in this series on Digital Maturity we talked about Leadership & Strategy in the context of Digital Maturity and as one of 6 key parameters of the Mosaic Island digital maturity model and assessment.

In this post we will discuss another One of the Six key parameters of Digital maturity, Governance & Delivery

## Governance and Delivery
When we talk about Governance and Delivery we are talking about the capability of your organisation to mobilise, control, steer and execute Digital change in support of your Digital Strategy. We have found a mature approach to governance and delivery often has the following attributes:

## Vehicles for Delivery
The mature Digital organisation has a defined, resourced and invested delivery vehicle (programme, projects, product teams etc.) that will deliver its digital initiatives. Highly visible programmes of work with a clear and communicated vision can become a lightning rod for organisational focus and action.

## Distributed decision making against standards and guidance

Decision making is pushed as far down into the teams responsible for delivery as possible, empowering teams to respond as they learn during their deliveries and reducing waste through delays. This distribution of decision making is made easier by the definition, communication and enforcement of governable assets such as standards, policies, principles, guidance, patterns, that provide both structure and positive constraints within which decisions can be made.

## Agile Delivery
An Agile style of delivery optimises the delivery of feedback, learning and empowerment of the delivery teams, enabling them to deliver value early and often to its organisation.

## Multi-skilled teams

Successful Digital projects are most often the result of the expertise and collaboration of various experts (business experts, analysts, architects, developers, user researchers, testers etc.) with unique skills and perspectives delivering more than the sum of their parts. The mature Digital organisation creates and fosters these multi-disciplinary teams and optimises for their collaboration.

## Just enough Governance
Effective and efficient governance for Digital initiatives is ‘just enough’. With as much decision making distributed within the delivery teams as possible, central governance can focus on strategic governance of the Digital programme.

## Just enough Architecture

The most effective and efficient architecture governance happens constantly through early and embedded engagement as part of the delivery team, ideally as ‘governance through design’. Early and continued engagement of architects during the whole lifecycle of a project, combined with a clear set of governable assets (policies, principles, standards, patterns) enables architecture governance e.g. formal architecture review boards aligned to key project/programme milestones to be light touch and minimise waste.

## Senior Engagement and Ownership

The mature Digital organisation’s Digital projects have strong, committed and continuous engagement and ownership from senior leadership, that influences, removes obstacles and champions the work done by the project teams.

## Aligned IT
Technology delivery (IT) teams have appropriate resource, investment and skills to support the delivery of the organisation’s digital projects. It’s IT strategy and therefore the IT team’s work priorities are aligned toward enabling the delivery of the Digital Strategy.

## Beyond Governance and Delivery
In the next post in this series we will talk about another of the Six key parameter of Digital maturity, Information Governance, what that means, and what good looks like in terms of Digital maturity.
