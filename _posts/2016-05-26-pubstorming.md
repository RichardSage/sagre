How many great ideas and conversations have you had down the pub?

Good friends + good banter + good beer = good ideas

I’ve been pondering off an on for a while whether there are a set of techniques that can help facilitate and capture those brilliant beer-soaked ideas. Think Dave Gray, Sunni Brown and James Macanufo’s Gamestorming, but designed specifically for the pub with its specific environment e.g. limited space, small number of resources, noise, close proximity of strangers (or potential participants!). I call this fledgling idea Pubstorming.

In my head (where i live most of the time) i’m imagining things culminating in a small number of techniques that fit the environment and pubstorming meet ups, branded beer mats/post-it note hybrids and all that shit.

The next question is, what would those techniques be? time to get my thinking hat on. Does this sound like a good idea to you? What would/should Pubstorming look like to you?
