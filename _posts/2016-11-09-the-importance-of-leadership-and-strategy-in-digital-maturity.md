In the previous post in this series on Digital Maturity we talked about what Digital is, what Digital Maturity is, in terms of Mosaic Island’s Digital Maturity Model and the benefits of understanding the Digital Maturity of your organisation in order to inform your Digital Business Transformation.

In this post, we will discuss in more detail, One of the Six key parameters of Digital maturity in the Mosaic Island Digital Maturity Model, Leadership & Strategy.

## Leadership & Strategy

Digital initiatives need leadership and strategy like a car needs a GPS, windows and steering wheel and a boat needs a sail and a rudder. From our experience, we have seen that Mature Digital Leadership and Strategy requires a different approach for many organisations from traditional strategy development and often demonstrates the following attributes:

## Definition and Direction

The Digitally mature organisation has a clearly defined Digital strategy that sets a clear direction for your organisation and is built around a core of a diagnosis of the problem space, a guiding policy and a coherent set of actions. Its strategy is opinionated and decisive, it has made clear decisions about where to play and how to win to maximise the impact of Digital in its organisation and for its customers.

## Communication

Colleagues understand their organisation’s Digital strategy, their role in achieving it and the benefits they will realize. Its colleagues understand the rationale behind the strategic decisions, not only because that rationale is explained and communicated, but in many cases because they were involved in the co-creation of the strategy.

## Democratization and perspective
The organisation’s Digital strategy was not developed in an ‘ivory tower’ and communicated downwards as a fait accompli. It’s strategy development involved inputs and insight from across it’s organisation and customers.

## Responsibility and Accountability
Responsibility and accountability for execution of its Digital strategy is clearly defined at all levels of the organisation. This clarity engenders personal responsibility and empowerment within its colleagues.

## Alignment

There is a symbiotic, coherent and mutually supportive relationship between the organisation’s Digital strategy, its business strategy and related supporting strategies.

## Scope
The organisation’s Digital initiatives are not limited to sprinkling Digital fairy dust on legacy process and practice. The scope of Digital includes re-imagining and challenging the core business operations and business model.

## Benefits
The benefits of the organisation’s Digital initiatives are clearly defined, communicated and understood.

## Inspect and Adapt

Whilst the strategic direction is clear and coherent, the organisation accepts that its strategy is a collection of hypotheses and assumptions, as such it regularly reviews progress against its strategy and reviews and challenges its strategy and the assumptions and hypothesis on which it was based.

## Beyond Leadership & Strategy

To extend our car analogy, probably a bit too far, you won’t get far in car if all you can do is look out the windows and turn the steering wheel. In the next post in this series we will talk about another of the Six key parameter of Digital Maturity, Governance and Delivery, what that means, and what good looks like in terms of Digital maturity.
