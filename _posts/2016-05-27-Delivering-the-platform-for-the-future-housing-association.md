In a previous post i defined a vision for a Future Housing Association. In this post I will propose one approach to delivering the Future Housing Association, not just for one housing association, but potentially for all housing associations.

Before I start I think its important to state that what i’m about to describe is just one element of the fundamental redesign of housing associations that need to take place in order achieve the Future Housing Association. The Future Housing Association is about more than just some new technology, it requires root and branch redesign of Organisation, Roles, Skills, Process, Service, Governance, Finance, etc. However the vision of the Future Housing association can only be achieved through the application of technology, this is what this post will focus on.

## Build an Open Source platform for housing
(Neil Tamplin wrote an excellent post a while back on this very subject which referenced some of my previous posts around this subject, in a way this post is part of an extended open conversation around this topic). I won’t go through the arguments and statements of the previous posts referenced above, you can read them!)

## What?
My view is this, if we as a community of Housing Associations want to take control of our own destiny then we should work together to create an Open Source platform for housing. Funded by the community, built for the community, designed with our customers.

## Why?
(excepting business model variations e.g. a care and support arm here, a telecare off there) We all do the same things, providing similar services to customer

We are seldom happy with the technology or services provided by incumbents

We are repeatedly forking out to duplicate functionality

We are unable as a community to give our incumbent suppliers the necessary kick up the arse required to deliver technology to truly enable the efficient, customer centred digital value chains that our organisations require to adapt and survive

Imagine a platform, that enables the Future Housing Association, that is free from legacy constraints, that is designed to meet customer needs in a mobile first world. Imagine that you have direct influence on the development of this platform. Imagine that, if your organisation was unable to sponsor such an initiative it could still able to take advantage of this platform for free.

Imagine how freeing and disruptive it would be to the housing technology market. Just having a viable Open Source alternative would be enough to shake up the incumbent market.

Whats the alternative? stick with the same dusty suppliers and hope some disruptive fairy dust might get sprinkled on one of them? buy a square peg ERP and either fit squash your business and customers around it, or pay through the nose to have the corners shaved off?

## How?
### Organisation
I propose that an independent organisation (lets call it Org X) is set up to design, develop and govern the creation of the platform for housing. I imagine the actual team delivering the platform as a constantly changing mix of core Org X employees and Housing Association employees drafted/seconded in and out over time depending on the focus at the time.

### Funding
The Org X would be funded by a number of sponsoring Housing Associations that commit to annual funding, access to resource and governance. Given the current inflated spend of Housing Association IT (as it tried to manage its legacy whilst also supporting digital agendas), the required investment to support Org X, assuming a minimum number of sponsors is achieved, would be negligible when compared to the annual IT spend of most large Housing associations.

### Open Source, Open Process
The entire design, development and governance of Org X will be radically transparent, Just as all code written will be open source, so all decisions around product roadmap, backlog, governance, financials etc will be transparent, to give confidence to sponsoring organisations and the wider Housing Association community.

### Integrate then assimilate
This is a huge undertaking, that would not happen over night, so the strategy has to be one of Integrate with incumbent suppliers software, then over time replace the need for them as the product roadmap rapidly assimilates the functionality of incumbent systems into the platform. To enable this approach a first step may be definition of standards around housing data and API to facilitate both standardisation and interoperability within the sector.

## Interested?
Who thinks this is a good idea? Who thinks this is a rubbish idea, why? Who wants to get involved? Who wants to sponsor? I’m interested to gauge responses to this post. Please do comment or contact me via twitter
