In our previous post in this series on Digital Maturity we talked about Information Governance in the context of Digital Maturity. In this, the 7th post in the series we will discuss another One of the Six key parameters of Digital maturity, Digital Capabilities.

## Digital Capabilities
As an organisation progresses on its journey to increasing Digital Maturity the journey draws out new capabilities that the organisation requires to progress. We have found a mature approach to Digital Capabilities often has the following attributes:

## Empowering colleagues and customers through self-service
The Mature Digital organisation has invested to ensure its customers are able to self-serve all but the most complex interactions with it. It has used its understanding of customer need and journeys to provide appropriate self-service through digital channels. The same is also true of the organisationâ€™s colleagues, who are freed from mundane tasks through self-service and automation.

## Empowering colleagues through tools

Colleagues are empowered to work when and how they like in order to meet their business objectives and needs of their customers. The organisation has invested in appropriate tooling, supported by policy and working practices, driven by an understanding of the needs and requirements of their colleagues.

## Optimised and Integrated Core Processes

Mature Digital organisations have invested in optimising and automating core business processes. Digital organisations have mapped their business process and have a roadmap and continuous pipeline of processes to be automated and optimised, married to a suite of key KPIs that are focused on driving continued process improve in support of customer service delivery. Colleagues within the Digital organisation are able to focus on activities where they add the most value, rather than mundane, rote activities.

## User Experience
Mature Digital organisations have a strongly developed capability in user experience design, deploying a fundamentally human/user centred approach to understand, design, gain feedback from and iterate upon improvements to User Experience.

## Modern architecture

Mature Digital organisations have invested in modern architectures (Cloud, SOA, Serverless) that are scalable and flexible to accommodate an increasingly dynamic pace of business and enable their technology teams to focus on delivering tangible value to the organization rather than focusing on legacy and maintenance.
