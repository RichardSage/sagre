Do you believe in one or more of these methods?

Do you have a preferred combination of the above?

Do you think your method choices make any real difference if you donâ€™t have a motivated collection of individuals working together to achieve a shared goal?

Working in technology today it feels like we have almost as many popular methods as we have problems to solve and yet none of them really address the most important aspects of delivering change, that of building, designing, evaluating, motivating, evolving, developing, coaching, leading dynamic teams. If we look at Scrum for example, a method focused on optimising teams, it reduces people to abstract role definitions.

And yet the groundwork is there, Belbin, Fielder, Hertzberg, Maslow, Myers & Briggs, Margerison and McCann, Tuckman and a host of others have each given us a composite narrative around personality, people, motivation and team dynamics, and yet very little of it has permeated through into the popular methods we use to deliver work.

I feel we are missing a trick, a trick where we might talk about team empowerment without really digging into what it means, where we might talk about empathy for customers but not direct that empathy internally towards our teammates. In focusing on methods that do not tackle the hard problems of the dynamic interplay of complex emotional beings we will continue to miss this trick.
