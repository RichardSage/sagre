In our previous post we discussed the value in using the Business Model Canvas to map out your organisation’s business model as a first step to developing a Digital Strategy. In my consulting I find discovery of the key value chains of the business as a key tool to inform the development of a Digital Strategy.

## What is a Value Chain?
A value chain is a group of business processes and activities which aim to deliver something of high value to the organisation. This can either be an end product or something internal. These are usually small in number (3–8), (if you’ve got more, it may be that you are sprawling General Electric-type conglomerate, or you may have gone into too much detail).

Developing Value Chains as part of your Digital Strategy development is a great way to get a high level understanding of the activities that add value to your business and your customers, and can also start highlight areas of potential waste and opportunity for Digital to transform your value chains.

Luckily, the work undertaken to develop the Canvas has already helped us understand what those key value chains are. The ‘Key Activities’ in the Canvas are the key Value Chains of your business.

Building on the Housing Association example in the previous post we have 6 Key Values chains:

• Customer Management

• Property Development

• Asset Management

• Tenure Management

• Care and Support

• Community Investment

## Example Value Chain
Taking one of these as an example, here we have a high level view of the key phases of a Tenure Management Value chain and some of the high level activities that occur within the in-life tenancy phase:

Through workshops and analysis, we can flesh this value chain out into the next level of detail:

Detailed Tenure Management Value Chain
Even at this high level, mapping the activities of the Value Chain gives us a wealth of useful information to inform out Strategy, This Value Chain draws out actors, systems, touchpoints, stakeholders and dependencies, as well as areas of potential silo working, manual process, delays, waste and opportunity.

A key thing to note is, this is not a long drawn out in-depth process analysis, this specific Value Chain could be produced as part of a half-day workshop with the right people in the room. The result is something meaningful and communicable that can be the basis for discussions around Digital strategy.

Just a quick review of the Value Chain enables us to ask some interesting questions that we might answer as we develop the strategy.

· Why is the tenancy sign-up process still paper-based?

· Why do we need to ring the customer to check if they are still interested in a property?

· Can we make the rent payment set up easier?

· Why are we siloing settling in visit notes in a spreadsheet?

· How can we use feedback during the sign-up process to improve the customer experience?

· Why is the mutual exchange process still largely paper-based?

· Why are we putting different documents in one of 3 different document management systems?

· How are we keeping customers informed during the ASB decision process?

· Why are we double-keying data about tenancy breaches?

· Why are we siloing information about tenancy support away from key systems?

· Why is the end of tenancy process still primarily paper-based?

· Why do two different people need to inspect a void property at two different times?

## Summary
In summary, through developing the Value Chains for your organisation you should now be able to identify:

· Inefficiencies in business activities such as variant processes, duplication of effort, delays and waste

· Processes which are poorly supported by Technology and/or present an opportunity for your Digital Strategy

· And collected a whole load of thoughts and ideas from the people you have interviewed about associated challenges and how to solve them

In the next post we will discuss how you can build on the Value Chain analysis to identify the components that underpin and enable them, and use analysis of these to start estimating and planning key areas of activity for your Digital strategy.
