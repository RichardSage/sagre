In our previous posts in this series we discussed using the Business Model Canvas as a starting point for developing your Digital Strategy. We then built on the Key Activities section of the Canvas to develop the Value Chains of your organisation, the key activities and processes that deliver value to your customers and your business. By doing this we showed how a small amount of effort in discovering your Value Chains can be really useful in helping identify areas of waste and opportunities for improvement for your Digital Strategy.

## Mapping Deeper
Having developed the Value Chains, a primarily left-to-right, process-centric view of your business, in many ways this next step is about adding depth or a vertical dimension to the existing horizontal, time based view provided by the value chains.

At this stage in developing your digital strategy you may be asking the following types of question:

· What do I need to change to help transform my business?

· What are the dependencies that I need to be aware of?

· How much effort do I need to expend to move the enabling components to where they need to be?

· Where are the opportunities to take advantage of technology?

· Where might new opportunities emerge during the lifetime of the strategy?

· What should we build/buy/outsource?

· How should we approach delivery of the strategy?

## Wardley Maps
To do this we will use Wardley maps. Wardley maps are a form of Value Chain analysis developed by Simon Wardley (researcher at LEF), that map the components of a Value chain against their evolution from Genesis, to Custom Built, Product and Commodity. A recognizable example of this type of evolution might be the Bike, moving from

Genesis (Laufmaschine and Draisine), to Custom Built (Velocipede), to Product (Michaux, Penny Farthing, Flying Pigeon), to Commodity (Boris Bike). Simon’s blog also has some excellent examples of the application of Wardley maps http://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html

## Mapping Tenure Management, an example
At the end of the previous blog post we had developed a high level Value Chain model for Tenure Management, so we now have a good understanding of the end to end process and most of its key activities and components. By way of example we will develop a Wardley map for the ‘New Tenancy’ part of the Tenure Management Value Chain and show how this can help inform your Digital Strategy by answering some of the questions we stated above.

This Wardley map was created by reviewing the Value Chain, identifying its key steps and then thinking about the components that underpin them. From this we then sketch out a model (paper is good) and by doing so identify missing elements. Once comfortable with the components we then place them on the X (Evolution) axis. There is likely to be several iterations of this as you refine your thinking and discuss it with colleagues. A key benefit of using a technique such as Wardley maps is, if you map the context then you can start to have conversations with your colleagues about it!

## Guidance
If you are not sure where something sits on the X axis, Simon has provided a useful guide (below), but to be clear, it is only a guide:

## Analysis
Now that we have an acceptable iteration of our map we can do a simple overlay of areas of opportunity.

We can see that paper still plays a critical role in the new tenancy Value Chain. Offer letters, Sign-up packs and Settling in records. The paper-based components are areas of potential inefficiency and delays in the value chain (e.g. postage), a source of inflated cost (printing/mail/handling/etc.) and a source of poor quality data (e.g. double entry of data). Each of these are potential areas of opportunity for the Digital strategy. How can we design out costly, inefficient paper-based processes?

We can also see the crucial role that HA employees (e.g. Lettings Officers/Income Officers/Customer Service Advisors) take in the Value chain. There are customer interactions through the process that make sense for HA employees to be involved in e.g. provision of Tenancy support (if needed). But there are also plenty where HA employee involvement doesn’t add value. For example, telephone surveys, letter creation/mailing and processing. Appointments are also a key component that HA employees are involved in during assessment, sign-up and settling visit stages of the Value Chain. Does employee involvement in appointment setting add any value to the process? Could this be done differently, enabling customers to self-serve their appointments?

Throughout the value chain there are at least 4 separate face-to-face meetings that involve HA employees (Assessment, Viewing, Sign-up, Settling visit). Do all of these add value to the customer and the HA? Could part or all of each of those meetings be delivered over digital channels to increase efficiency e.g. Skype call replacing Settling visit, assessment and sign-up completed mainly online?

## Focus
So we can see, from mapping the component parts of the Value Chain on a map we can start to identify lots of areas of potential opportunity as we develop our Digital strategy and where we might want to focus activity in order to improve the efficiency and customer experience of the value chain. Building on our hypothetical example:

Based on our analysis above we have highlighted where we need to move specific components of the value chain. Mapping out the desired target state also starts to give us a feel for the likely effort that is required in order to achieve the target state.

## Conclusion
In summary, we find Wardley maps to be a great tool to:

a) look differently at a process centric Value Chain

b) Identify components of the Value Chain and their dependencies

c) Identify areas of opportunity for your Digital strategy

d) Get a feel for the scale of effort required to achieve the desired state of your Digital Value Chain

e) (most importantly) enable communication and discussion of the Value Chain

So ends the third post in our series about using illuminatory (and quick!) analysis techniques to develop the understanding you need when developing a Digital (or in fact any) Strategy. All feedback is good feedback so feel free to hit me up on twitter, or leave a comment.
