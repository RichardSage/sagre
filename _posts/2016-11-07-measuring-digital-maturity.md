In our 1st post in this series about the importance of understanding Digital Maturity we explored what ‘Digital’ means and what its high level implications are for organisations. In this post we will start to dig into what Digital Maturity is and what key parameters influence an organisation’s Digital Maturity.

## Digital Maturity Model
Based on our experience across multiple sectors we have defined a Digital Maturity Model and assessment. Our Digital Maturity Model defines 5 stages of maturity from ‘Digital Denial’ through to ‘Disruptor’:

### 1) Digital Denial

Digital Denial organisations are oblivious, in denial or unable to see how Digital can transform their business operations and customer experience. They lack effective Digital leadership, governance and the ability to execute. A classic example would be Blockbuster.

### 2) Digital Basic

Basic organisations have started to use Digital to gain efficiencies and improve customer services in some areas of their organisation, but are often layering Digital upon legacy thinking, process, structure and systems.

### 3) Digital Advanced

Advanced organisations recognise Digital as a key capability for enabling efficiency and enhanced customer experiences. They have re-implemented some of their key business processes Digitally.

### 4) Digital Differentiator

Differentiator organisations have harnessed Digital to create a Digital business model that sets them apart from peers and competition in regards to product excellence, efficiency and/or customer experience.

### 5) Digital Disruptor

Disruptor organisations have used Digital to fundamentally re-think their business model to such an extent that they have disrupted the sector or sectors that they operate in. Competitors are playing catchup to the organisation’s new Digitally enabled business model.

Your organisation will exist somewhere within this maturity scale, exactly where you are will influence what type of journey you will require to achieve Digital Business Transformation.

## The Parameters of Digital Maturity

In order to assess your organisation’s Digital Maturity you need to assess your organisation across the various key drivers of Digital Maturity. Through our work delivering Digital Business Transformation we have identified 6 key areas or ‘parameters’ which influence and dictate an organisation’s Digital maturity:

* Leadership & Strategy
* Governance & Delivery
* Information Governance
* Digital Capabilities
* Culture & Organisation
* Customer Experience  
In this post we have outlined the parameters that influence an organisation’s Digital Maturity. In the next posts in this series we will talk through each of these parameters, what they mean, and what good looks like in terms of Digital Maturity for each parameter.
