 **TLDR**: We should create an exemplar of The Future Housing Association to positively disrupt ourselves and demonstrate the new possibilities for the sector.

## Problem
In my previous posts i stated a vision for the future housing association. The feedback was great and very positive, it obviously struck a chord. Some fed back that actually they felt they were on the road to achieving parts of the vision i set out and thats great! my concluding point was that the Future Housing Association is achievable now if we will it. However, from my experience in the sector not everyone is on this journey, or even aware that it exists as a possibility and those that are, are fighting the good fight through organisational treacle.

It feels to me like the sector has been at a meandering turning point since 2008. Reactions have been mergers, re-orgs and (some would argue) re-focusing away from the core social purpose of housing associations. However the vision and practical execution of these changes are so often bogged down in the accreted detritus of their current states.

Whilst external forces like the current government seem intent on (some might say negatively) disrupting the sector, maybe there is a way of harnessing this moment of opportunity to positively disrupt ourselves in a way that frees our thinking and execution from the shackles (or detritus or treacle, whatever metaphor you prefer) of the current state and history.

## Solution
I propose one way we can do that is create a ‘Housing Association Skunkworks’, a sector-sponsored initiative to create a ‘greenfield’ Housing Association, that:

1. Provides a real exemplar of the possibilities of the Future Housing association
2. Provides a controlled scenario for us to radically innovate
## How?
How would we do this? here is my (evolving) 7 part plan:

1. Obtain funding from a group of forward-thinking Housing Associations to create the Housing Association Skunkworks
2. Build a multi-disciplinary team to deliver it (✋)
3. Cultivate a volunteer group of existing Housing Association customers who are willing to have their services delivered by the skunkworks for a set period of time
4. Understand user need (customer/tenant/resident, whatever effective synonym floats your boat), design the service, pull in (which may involve design and create) the platforms to deliver the service, then think about the organisation (In this order! not the reverse!)
5. Deliver the new Minimum Viable Housing Association
6. Iterate, share, iterate, share, iterate, share, etc etc
7. Work with the sector to help drive new service design, process, technology and organisation into receptive housing associations
  This sounds like a bold move, but it is achievable. Who is up for it?
